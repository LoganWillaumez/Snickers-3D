# Snickers-3D

My first project using three.js and threefiber.js.

I also wanted to try another global state management, Valtio. A good alternative to Redux.

The model was downloaded for free on sketchfab : https://skfb.ly/ovUwx

## Stack

- React.js
- Three fiber.js
- Typescript
- Vite

## Install

Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed Node.js â‰¥ 12

1. Install dependencies :

```bash
yarn

# or

npm i

# or

pnpm i
```

2. To launch locally :

```bash
yarn dev

# or

npm run dev

#or

pnpm run dev
```

## Know Issues

- The loading is slow, due to the the vercel solution (not a problem on local)
- Maybe slow on old phones.
